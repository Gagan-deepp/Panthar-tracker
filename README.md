# Testing Tracker 🎯

Hey there, fellow developer! 👋 Welcome to Testing Tracker - your new best friend for managing projects, tracking issues, and keeping clients happy. This isn't just another boring project management tool; it's a carefully crafted system that actually makes your life easier (and yes, it has dark mode because we're not savages).

## ✨ What Makes This Special?

Picture this: You're juggling multiple clients, each with their own projects, tickets flying left and right, and feedback coming in faster than you can handle. Sound familiar? That's exactly why I built this beauty. It's like having a personal assistant who never sleeps, never complains, and always knows where you left that important ticket.

### 🎪 The Main Show
- **🔐 Smart Authentication** - Email-based login that just works (no password headaches!)
- **👥 Client Whispering** - Keep track of who's who without losing your mind
- **📋 Project Zen** - Organize projects like a meditation master
- **🎫 Ticket Mngment** - Turn chaos into organized bliss
- **💬 Feedback** - Transform client complaints into actionable insights
- **👤 Team** - Manage your squad like a benevolent dictator

### 🛠️ The Technical Goodies
- **📱 Mobile-First Love** - Because we code on the toilet sometimes (don't judge)
- **🌙 Dark Mode Glory** - Your eyes will thank you during those 3 AM coding sessions
- **🔍 Search Feature** - Find anything faster than you can say "where did I put that?"
- **📊 Visual Dashboard** - Pretty charts that make you look professional
- **🔄 Real-time Changes** - Updates faster than your coffee gets cold
- **🎨 UI That Doesn't Suck** - Clean, modern, and actually pleasant to use

## 🧠 The Brain Behind the Beauty

### Frontend Arsenal
- **Next.js 14** - Because we like our React served fresh with App Router goodness
- **Next.js Server Action** - Next.js magic that feels like cheating (but legal)
- **NextAuth.js** - Authentication that doesn't make you want to throw your laptop
- **shadcn/ui** - Components so beautiful they make you cry happy tears


## 🚀 Let's Get This Party Started

### What You'll Need
- **Node.js 18+** (because we're not living in the stone age)
- **Your favorite package manager** (npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun - I don't judge)
- **A cup of coffee / Tea might work too** (optional but highly recommended)

### The Magic Ritual

1. **Grab the goods**
```bash
git clone <your-awesome-repo-url>
cd testing-tracker
```

2. **Feed the dependencies**
```bash
npm install
# or if you're team yarn
yarn install
# or if you're feeling fancy
pnpm install
# or if you're speed-obsessed
bun install
```

3. **Set up your secrets** 🤫
Create a `.env.local` file (this is where the magic happens):
```env
# Your super secret key - make it longer than your last relationship
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-incredibly-long-and-random-secret-that-nobody-can-guess

# Where your app lives
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

4. **Wake up the beast**
```bash
npm run dev
# or your preferred incantation
```

5. **Witness the glory**
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and prepare to be amazed!

## 🎨 Making It Yours

### Theme Customization
This baby comes with a design system that's more flexible than a yoga instructor:

- **OKLCH Colors** - Color science that actually makes sense
- **CSS Variables** - Change themes like you change your socks
- **Dark Mode** - Because your retinas deserve better
- **Custom Fonts** - Geist Sans and Mono for that premium feel

Want to tweak the colors? Just hop into `app/globals.css` and go wild with the CSS variables. It's like painting, but with code!

### API Configuration
All the backend magic happens at:
```
https://tracker-backend-708150210175.asia-south1.run.app/api/v1/
```

Need to point it somewhere else? Just update the `BASE_URL` in the action files. Easy peasy!

## 🎪 The Feature Circus

### 📊 Dashboard Central
Your command center where everything comes together. Think of it as mission control, but prettier and with better coffee.

### 👥 Client Management
Keep track of your clients without losing your sanity. Store their info, link them to projects, and never again ask "Wait, who was this for?"

### 📋 Project Paradise
Create projects, assign teams, set deadlines, and watch the magic happen. It's like project management, but fun!

### 🎫 Ticket Tango
Turn chaos into organized tickets. Assign, track, prioritize, and close them like a boss. Your future self will thank you.

### 💬 Feedback Fiesta
Collect client feedback with ratings and turn complaints into improvements. It's like alchemy, but for customer satisfaction!

### 👤 User Universe
Manage your team with roles, permissions, and profiles. Democracy is great, but sometimes you need to be the benevolent dictator.

## 🚀 Launch Day (Deployment)

### GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
This project is primed for deployment on GCP. Here's how to get it up and running:
1. **Set Up GCP**
   - Create a GCP account if you haven't already.
   - Set up a project and enable the necessary APIs.
   - Set up a billing account.
   - Set up a Cloud Run service.


### Other Platforms (For the Adventurous)
This beauty runs anywhere Next.js is welcome:
- **Vercel** - The hipster choice
- **AWS Amplify** - The enterprise beast

## 🔧 Pro Tips & Tricks

### Environment Variables Cheat Sheet
| Variable | What It Does | Importance |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Keeps your auth secure | * Critical |

### Handy Commands
```bash
npm run dev      # Start the development party
npm run build    # Build for production (make it fast!)
npm run start    # Run the production build
npm run lint     # Make your code pretty
```

## 🆘 When Things Go Sideways

### Authentication Acting Up?
- Double-check that `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (make it long and random)
- Verify your backend is awake and responding
- Check the browser console - it usually tells you what's wrong

### Styles Looking Funky?
- Make sure Tailwind is configured properly
- Check if all CSS imports are in place
- Verify those CSS variables are defined
- Verify you don't  have any conflicting with auth middleware

### API Calls Failing?
- Check your internet connection (seriously, it happens)
- Verify the backend endpoints are correct
- Open the network tab and see what's actually happening

## 🎯 Final Words

This project is my love letter to developers who are tired of clunky, ugly, hard-to-use project management tools. I built it with care, attention to detail, and a healthy dose of caffeine.

Whether you're managing one project or fifty, tracking bugs or features, dealing with happy clients or... less happy ones, this tool has your back.

Now go forth and manage those projects like the coding wizard you are! ✨

**Built with ❤️, ☕, and probably too much attention to detail**

*P.S. - If you find this useful, give it a star! It makes me happy and costs you nothing. Win-win! 🌟*
